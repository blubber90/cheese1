In this challenge, you have the opportunity to exploit some basic XSS attacks. 
If you are not already familiar with XSS, make sure you've read the material on Canvas and 
engaged with the exercises provided (especially those defined by Google) before attempting this one!

This challenge is very similar to Session 1, except that you no longer have the search engine to play with. 
Is there another way you can add or modify the code?
